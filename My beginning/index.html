            <h2 class="h2-origin-container">Origin of The Term</h2>
            <img class="crowd" src="images/crowd.svg" "alt=" crowds">
            <p>One 2009 book states the name house music originated from a Chicago club called The Warehouse, which
                existed from 1977 to 1983.Clubbers to The Warehouse were primarily black, who came to dance to music
                played by the club's resident DJ Frankie Knuckles, who fans refer to as the "godfather of house".
                Frankie began the trend of splicing together different records when he found that the records he had
                weren't long enough to satisfy his audience of dancers. After the Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowds
                went to Knuckles' new club, The Power Plant.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up The Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term
                "house music" was upon seeing "we play house music" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South
                Side. One of the people in the car with him joked, "you know that's the kind of music you play down at
                the Warehouse!". South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard "Remix" Roy, in self-published statements, claims he put
                such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home;
                in his case, it referred to his mother's soul and disco records, which he worked into his sets. The
                documentary also explored how house music was something that anyone could do. Mostly the documentary
                looks at some of the DJs from that genre, and how they stumbled into the music.

                Farley Jackmaster Funk was quoted as saying "In 1982, I was DJing at a club called The Playground and
                there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Roy who was a DJ at a rival club called The Rink. He came over
                to my club one night, and into the DJ booth and said to me, 'I've got the gimmick that's gonna take all
                the people out of your club and into mine – it's called House music.' Now, where he got that name from
                or what made him think of it I don't know, so the answer lies with him."

                Chip E.'s 1985 recording "It's House" may also have helped to define this new form of electronic music.
                However, Chip E. himself lends credence to the Knuckles association, claiming the name came from methods
                of labeling records at the Importes Etc. record store, where he worked in the early 1980s: bins of music
                that DJ Knuckles played at the Warehouse nightclub were labelled in the store "As Heard At The
                Warehouse", which was shortened to simply "House". Patrons later asked for new music for the bins, which
                Chip E. implies was a demand the shop tried to meet by stocking newer local club hits. In a 1986
                interview, when Rocky Jones, the club DJ who ran the D.J. International record label, was asked about
                the "house" moniker, he did not mention Importes Etc., Frankie Knuckles, or the Warehouse by name.
                However, he agreed that "house" was a regional catch-all term for dance music, and that it was once
                synonymous with older disco music, before it became a way to refer to "new" dance music.
                <br>
                <br>

                Larry Heard, a.k.a. "Mr. Fingers", claims that the term "house" became popular due to many of the early
                DJs creating music in their own home studios using synthesizers and drum machines, such as the Roland
                TR-808 programmable drum machine, TR-909, and the TB 303 bassline synth. These synthesizers were used to
                create a house subgenre called acid house. Juan Atkins, an originator of Detroit techno music, claims
                the term "house" reflected the exclusive association of particular tracks with particular clubs and DJs;
                those records helped differentiate the clubs and DJs, and thus were considered to be their "house"
                records. In an effort to maintain such exclusives, the DJs were inspired to create their own "house"
                records.</p>
                
            <H2>Early Mixing Techniques</H2>
            <p>Early producers and club DJ innovators such as Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, DJ Ron Hardy, and the Hot
                Mix 5 played a major role in evolving Disco into early House Music, forever shaping the modern dance
                scene. Club DJs began exploring mixing and beatmatching records, applying editing techniques, playing
                narrative DJ sets, and experimenting with innovative ways to overcome the limitations of the DJ
                equipment in those times. Many of these DJs helped merge the roles of DJ, composer, producer, and
                remixer by creating and playing their own edits of their favorite songs on reel-to-reel tape. Some even
                took the music to the next level by mixing in effects or using drum machines and synthesizers which
                introduced the consistent 4/4 tempo. Disco quickly became a global fad, particularly after featuring
                films such as Saturday Night Fever in 1977. Commercialization lead to an explosion of club culture, and
                the record companies were looking to cash in on the popularity. Record labels would hire club DJs to
                bring their expertise to the studio as a helping hand to create music they knew would hype the
                dancefloor, and because they already had a direct connection to the dancing public. They often
                supervised studio-recording sessions as well for other artists and bands. In addition, record companies
                began commissioning remixes in an effort to help break and popularize artists through the underground
                channels of discotheques.</p>
            <h2>Disco Sucks Movement</h2>
            <p>In the late 70s, Disco quickly fell out of fashion almost overnight largely due to attacks from
                anti-disco DJs across the country. In addition, record companies had flooded the market with Disco
                songs. One of the most memorable and extreme anti-disco rallies was ‘Disco Demolition Night’ at Comiskey
                Park, July 12, 1979. Anyone who brought a Disco album to the double-header game between the White Sox
                and Detroit Tigers would be admitted for only 98 cents. During the game, radio personality Steve Dahl
                detonated a large collection of Disco LPs in an explosion on the field. Soon after, major record
                companies scaled down or eliminated their dance music production divisions.

                Disco’s decline was steep. Aletti remembers working at a record label around that time, and his entire
                department getting renamed: “We became the dance music department. Disco became a dirty word.” Renaming
                disco didn’t kill it, of course. Donna Summer still had hits, as did Michael Jackson, Lipps, Inc. and
                others. But an era had ended. By July 1981, the new wave magazine Trouser Press noticed disco had caught
                on amongst the English bands that would soon dominate the newly-created MTV. “I hate to break the news,
                but disco isn’t dead yet,” wrote Robert Payes in a Spandau Ballet review. “It’s just changed owners.”

            House Music is here to stay and will continue to evolve and develop new subgenres with the help of
            globalization, emerging technology, and cross-genre influences. There is much more to the story, explore
